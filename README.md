### 🌪️ The Problem
The **IIT Madras BS in Data Science & Applications** is a revolutionary degree, but let's be honest: tracking prerequisites, credit requirements, and exit paths can feel like solving a complex algorithm without a debugger. 
- *Which course unlocks which?* - *What do I need for the Diploma?* - *Am I on track?*

### 💡 The Solution
**IITM BS Roadmap** is a visual, interactive, and student-first web interface designed to demystify the curriculum. It serves as your GPS through the academic wilderness, helping you visualize the path from your first Foundation quiz to your final Capstone Project.

* [ ] 🧮 **GPA Calculator:** Estimate your CGPA based on hypothetical scores.
* [ ] 🔗 **Syllabus Links:** Direct links to official course content for every node.
* [ ] ✅ **Progress Tracker:** LocalStorage based checklist to mark completed courses.
